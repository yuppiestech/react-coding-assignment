### React Coding assignment

#### Brief

Implement a search page that accepts the user's query and displays the results as the user types along. Use the [Youtube Search API]([https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) to fetch the results.


#### Constraints

1. The solution should use React. Only the mobile implemention is required. The site does not need to look correct on desktop.
2. You can use bootstrap or any other OSS styling library to style the project. Avoid using any other npm libraries for coding the business logic.
3. If possible deploy your solution to a free hosting platform like Vercel or Surge.
4. Create a GitHub repo with your submission and follow best practices when it comes to commits, naming, code quality and architecture. You will have to explain your decisions.
